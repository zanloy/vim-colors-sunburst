#vim-colors-sunburst

## Summary

This is a vim colorscheme that was originally developed by
[Alex Max](https://github.com/AlexMax/.vim). This repo is just to port
the colorscheme to bundle format for easy installation.

## Install

If you do not already use a vim bundler, I recommend
[pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen).

To install with pathogen:

```
cd ~/.vim/bundle
git clone https://github.com/zanloy/vim-colors-sunburst.git
```

To use this colorscheme, add the following line to ~/.vimrc

```
colorscheme sunburst
```

To switch to this colorscheme while editing a file:

```
:colo sunburst
```

## Acknowledgements

This colorscheme was not developed by me. It was created by Alex Max. Full
props go to him. I only ported it to different format for easy installation
using a vim bundler.
